Leenk is a website that refer people who wants to share about Gaming. It allows you to make news friend around your favorite games. Create your profil, add your favorite games, and meet news people ! 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of [Leenk](www.leenk.eu), in which you will find a simple MVC project, still in progress.

```
// Create a new folder into your Xampp/Mampp/Wampp htdocs folder and get into it

cd path/to/folder

git clone https://github.com/KiryhQ/leenk_mvc.git
```



## Installing 

All you have to know is that the website uses a lot of SQL. Don't forget to create a new Database, and link it to the project into the Manager.php

```

// Get into Modele/manager.php and follow this model

$bdd = new PDO('mysql:host="localhost" ;dbname="NameOfYourDatabase";charset=utf8', 
                'root', '', array(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE => PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION));

```
Then, you can import "leenkDB.sql" on your Database.

Be sure to be into your htdocs folder. This project uses PDO, and seems to be more stable using the HTDOCS localhost system.



## Localhost

Once everything is done, all you have to do is to use this url to get access to the website.

Verify that you add your OWN folder

```
localhost/NameOfYourFolder/index.php

```

I added an .htaccess to the website, to redirect urls in a more readable way.

It turns

```
localhost/NameOfYourFolder/index.php?action=Example
```

Into 

```
localhost/NameOfYourFolder/app/Example
```

Some href/link may not be done at the moment, as it is not over. The first example is still set.

## Further Informations

I am sorry if the project seems confusing at the moment. Didn't had time to clarify everything, specially into Controllers/Managers, where I used a lot of $paramX

I am sure that you will understand the organisation of the project, but my internship require all my time at the moment. I hope you will understand.

You must know that Leenk will probably now a nice future. But I will probably turn the "Application" part into a real AngularJS application. And probably export everything into a Mobile Application. I've got the feeling that Leenk could be more useful under Mobile.
